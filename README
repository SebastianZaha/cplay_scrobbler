== Description ==

  Plugin for the 'cplay' music player that scrobbles played tracks to last.fm

  http://sebi.tla.ro/cplay_scrobbler


== Install ==

  To install, paste the contents of this file in your ~/.cplayrc and fill in 
  your username and password.

  If you play a track for more than half its length, it will be marked as a 
  'listened' track. When the next track starts playing, the former will be 
  submitted to last.fm.


== Requirements ==

  scrobbler - http://exhuma.wicked.lu/projects/python/scrobbler/


== Miscellaneous ==

  The plugin will only try submitting a track once. If it cannot (for reasons like no
  internet connection, scrobbler website down, etc) then it will NEVER try again.

  Also, the last track you listen to before you quit cplay will NOT be submitted.
      
  Tracks without ID3 tags will NOT be submitted.

  These limitations will hopefully be corrected in the future :)
